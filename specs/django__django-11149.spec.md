# Fix django__django-11149

## Goal
Resolve the bug described in the GitHub issue below. The fix must:

1. Reproduce the reported failure first (write a minimal repro script in
   `/tmp/repro.py`), then implement the fix, then confirm the repro now
   passes.
2. Change ONLY library/source files — do not modify, add, or remove anything
   under `tests/`, `testing/`, or any `*_test.py` file. The grader supplies
   its own tests.
3. Preserve all existing public API signatures and behavior unrelated to the
   bug. The smallest diff that makes the issue's repro pass without breaking
   any other behavior wins.
4. NOT add new public APIs, configuration options, or features.

## Original issue

Admin inlines for auto-created ManyToManyFields are editable if the user only has the view permission
Description
	
From https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8060#comment:34
Replying to Will Gordon:
This seems to have regressed in (at least) 2.1. I have 2 view only permissions. I have a ManyToManyField represented in my main model as a TabularInline. But, my user with view only permissions can now add or remove these items at will!
I am having the same issue, so I assume this is a bug. I did not find Will had created a separate ticket.
models.py:
class Photo(models.Model):
	pass
class Report(models.Model):
	photos = models.ManyToManyField(Photo)
admin.py:
		class ReportPhotoInlineModelAdmin(admin.TabularInline):
			model = Report.photos.through
			show_change_link = True


## Success Criteria
- [ ] The repro script in `/tmp/repro.py` (written during the reproduce step) ran red before the fix and runs green after.
- [ ] No files under `tests/`, `testing/`, or matching `*_test.py` were modified.
- [ ] No new public API symbols were added (verify via `git diff --stat` review).
- [ ] The diff is scoped to the minimum number of source files necessary.


## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 01: Reproduce and fix
- Scope: Reproduce the failure from the issue, then make the smallest possible source-code change that eliminates the failure without modifying tests or adding new public API.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] `/tmp/repro.py` exists and runs cleanly (exit 0) after the fix.
  - [ ] `git diff --stat HEAD~ -- tests/ testing/ '**/*_test.py'` is empty.
  - [ ] Imports unchanged for any module not central to the bug.
  - [ ] Generator's output-summary.md identifies the single root cause and explains why this diff is minimal.
- Depends on: none
- Type: backend

## Technical Approach
1. Read the failing stack trace / repro from the issue body.
2. Write `/tmp/repro.py` that triggers the exact failure cited.
3. Locate the smallest set of source files implicated by the trace.
4. Apply the minimum change that makes the repro pass.
5. Spot-check related code paths (Evaluator's Tier-2 review) for regression risk.

## Out of Scope
- Refactoring unrelated code, even if "while we're here" temptation arises.
- Adding new tests, fixtures, or test utilities.
- Updating documentation or changelogs.
- Modifying CI configuration, dependencies, or build files.

## Open Questions
(None — the issue body is the authoritative spec. Generator should
treat any ambiguity as "preserve existing behavior".)
